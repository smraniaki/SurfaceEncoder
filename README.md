Image Tile Autoencoder
======================

This project implements an autoencoder using TensorFlow and Keras to process and learn from image tiles. The autoencoder is designed to work on subdivided sections of a larger image, learning to compress and reconstruct these tiles.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   PIL (Python Imaging Library)
*   TensorFlow
*   Keras
*   Matplotlib

### Installation

To set up your environment to run this code, you'll need to install the required packages:

bashCopy code

`pip install pillow tensorflow keras matplotlib`

Usage
-----

This script is intended to be used with images that you wish to process using the autoencoder model. The main steps involved are:

1.  **Image Tiling**: The script splits an image into smaller tiles.
2.  **Autoencoder Training**: The autoencoder learns to compress and reconstruct these image tiles.
3.  **Model Saving**: The trained autoencoder model is saved for later use.

### Example

1.  Place your image in the root directory and name it `Subss.jpg` (or modify the script to point to your image).
2.  Run the script to train the autoencoder on your image tiles.
3.  The trained model will be saved as `my_autoencoder`.

Code Overview
-------------

*   **Image Processing**: The script uses PIL to open and tile the input image.
*   **Model Building**: It constructs an autoencoder model using Keras layers, including Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Conv2DTranspose layers.
*   **Training**: The model is trained using image tiles, with the option to customize epochs, batch size, etc.
